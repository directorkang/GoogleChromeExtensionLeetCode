1. Introduction
This user manual provides instructions for setting up and running automated tests for your extension using Selenium. Automated testing helps ensure that your extension functions correctly across different scenarios, enhancing its reliability and quality.

2. Installation
Before running the automated tests, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

Node.js
Chrome browser
Selenium WebDriver for Chrome (selenium-webdriver package)
ChromeDriver
To install the necessary Node.js packages, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm install selenium-webdriver chrome --save-dev
Make sure that ChromeDriver is installed and its path is added to the system environment variables.

3. Running Tests
To run the automated tests for your extension:

Clone or download the project repository containing your extension and the Selenium testing scripts.
Navigate to the directory containing the Selenium testing scripts.
Run the following command to execute the tests:
bash
Copy code
node seleniumTesting.js
The tests will launch the Chrome browser, load the specified webpage (e.g., LeetCode), and perform the defined test cases.
After the tests are completed, the browser will automatically close, and the test results will be displayed in the console.
4. Test Cases
The automated tests cover the following scenarios:

Loading the specified webpage with the extension enabled.
Extracting and storing completed questions from the webpage.
Initializing the pie chart with default values.
Updating pie chart data based on radio button selection.
